Trigger Monitoring Dashboard for Anticipatory Action (AA) - Geospatial Data Analysis 

(this is still an ongoing project) 


This project worked with the Columbia Univerisity Climate School. The aim of the project is to use statistical tools and geospatial data analytics for various policy and climate issues. 


The frequency and severity of extreme climate-induced natural disasters continue to rise, exacerbated by climate change. Countries in Africa are exposed to a wide range of weather-related disasters, climate-related outbreaks, and epidemics, which are increasing in severity and frequency across the continent. Climate risk is widespread, and in the past four decades, Africa has experienced more than 1,000 weather-related disasters, 300 of which occurred between 2005 and 2009 alone. In the past three decades, these have resulted in an estimated ~US$18 billion in damage. Droughts and floods pose the greatest risk to African economies and human life. These two hazards account for 80% of loss of life and 70% of economic losses linked to natural hazards.Anticipatory Actions (AA) aim to prevent or reduce the impact of predicted imminent extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, on at-risk populations linking forecast triggers to previously determined humanitarian actions. It requires defined actions and prearranged funding, by stakeholders and partners, to reach households or communities ahead of a forecasted weather shock. Actions such as cash, in-kind support such as food assistance, and early warning messaging can be implemented in the critical window between a forecast and an extreme weather event to reduce its impact on vulnerable populations, save lives, and protect livelihoods.The focus will be on developing open-source models and dashboards, from publicly available datasets (socio-economic, climate, satellite, etc.) to facilitate decision-making for Anticipatory Actions.
